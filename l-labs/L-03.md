### Defining Black Boxes

Black baxes are crash resistant devices that are often referred to as EDRs. The device will record data about a crash and the moments leading up to it in order to help with understanding how to improve safety and avoid similar events.

Most black boxes are behind the steering wheel or in the dash somewhere. They are often embedded to prevent ease of access, as it would hopefully never need to be accessed.

### History

Some companies

### Current Status

Most modern cars after 2013 have these black boxes. "Less than 5 percent of new cars came without one in 2013"[(Does my car have a black box)](https://www.hyperlube.com/blog/blog/does-my-car-have-a-black-box/). Cars before this time still had black boxes, it just was not as uniform.
