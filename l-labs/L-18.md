### Definitions

- Load balancing distributes the work to be done by the computer across all CPUs.
- Process migration redistributes the load from CPUs working more heavily to those that are not. Processors not in use pull in new tasks to complete.
- Soft real-time systems may operate close to real time and on real-time principles, but they are not garunteed to complete everything in real time.
- Hard real-time systems are required to meet a predetermined deadline and there are no excuses, it must garuntee that all deadlines can be met.
- Priority-based scheduling ensures that all tasks meet their deadlines and gives the processor to the highest priority process next.
- Earliest deadline simply starts the process that has the nearest deadline with no regard to priority or efficiency.
- Completely fair scheduler calculates a virtual run time that is built off the context of the task and the system, wichever task has the lowest virtual run time, it will schedule next.

### Windows

It seems as if windows 10 still utilizes the scheduling method described.
