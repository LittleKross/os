### Test Cases Outline

```cmd
%ll –c apple //this program creates a list apple and does work
%ll –p //this program prints a list and does work
%ll apple –a zebra //adds zebra to the list and does work
%ll apple –d zebra //deletes zebra from the list and does work
```

We will need to test -a with a list provided, with no list provided, and with no list created.

We will need to test -d with a list provided, an empty list provided, with no list provided, and with no list created.

### a ADD

Initial Setup:

```cmd
%ll -c test
%ll -p
```

This will create the required list and check its starting contents.

Test list provided steps:

```cmd
%ll test -a zebra
%ll -p
```

Test list not provided steps:

```cmd
%ll -a zebra
%ll -p
```

Test list non-existant:

```cmd
%ll listnotreal -a zebra
%ll -p
```

The first test should add the zebra element to the test list as described in the provided instructions. The -p call should verify that the element was added correctly.
When the test list is not provided then the -p should verify that the element did not get added. The %ll program may also return an error. When the listnotreal is passed to the program it should show some kind of error. The -p should also verify that the element was not added.

### d DELETE

Initial Setup:

```cmd
%ll -c test
%ll test -a zebra
```

This should create a list with one element.

Test list provided steps:

```cmd
%ll test -d zebra
%ll -p
```

Test list empty steps:

```cmd
%ll -c emptylist
%ll emptylist -d zebra
%ll -p
```

Test list not provided steps:

```cmd
%ll -d zebra
%ll -p
```

Test list non-existant:

```cmd
%ll nonexistantlist -d subject
%ll -p
```

The first test should add the zebra element to the test list as described in the provided instructions. The -p call should verify that the element was added correctly. The second test should throw an error and then the print command verifies that the element was not removed. When the test list is not provided then the -p should verify that the element did not get removed. The %ll program may also return an error. When the nonexistantlist is passed to the program it should show some kind of error. The -p should also verify that the element was not removed.
